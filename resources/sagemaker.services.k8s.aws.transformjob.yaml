      maxConcurrentTransforms:
        description: The maximum number of parallel requests that can be sent to each instance in a transform job. If MaxConcurrentTransforms is set to 0 or left unset, Amazon SageMaker checks the optional execution-parameters to determine the settings for your chosen algorithm. If the execution-parameters endpoint is not enabled, the default value is 1. For more information on execution-parameters, see How Containers Serve Requests (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-batch-code.html#your-algorithms-batch-code-how-containe-serves-requests). For built-in algorithms, you don't need to set a value for MaxConcurrentTransforms.

      maxPayloadInMB:
        description: "The maximum allowed size of the payload, in MB. A payload is the data portion of a record (without metadata). The value in MaxPayloadInMB must be greater than, or equal to, the size of a single record. To estimate the size of a record in MB, divide the size of your dataset by the number of records. To ensure that the records fit within the maximum payload size, we recommend using a slightly larger value. The default value is 6 MB. \n The value of MaxPayloadInMB cannot be greater than 100 MB. If you specify the MaxConcurrentTransforms parameter, the value of (MaxConcurrentTransforms * MaxPayloadInMB) also cannot exceed 100 MB. \n For cases where the payload might be arbitrarily large and is transmitted using HTTP chunked encoding, set the value to 0. This feature works only in supported algorithms. Currently, Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms do not support HTTP chunked encoding."
