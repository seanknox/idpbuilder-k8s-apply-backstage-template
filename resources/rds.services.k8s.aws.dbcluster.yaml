      publiclyAccessible:
        description: "A value that indicates whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible. \n When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it. \n When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. \n Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether DBSubnetGroupName is specified. \n If DBSubnetGroupName isn't specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified, the following applies: \n * If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private. \n * If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public. \n If DBSubnetGroupName is specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified, the following applies: \n * If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private. \n * If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public. \n Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only"
