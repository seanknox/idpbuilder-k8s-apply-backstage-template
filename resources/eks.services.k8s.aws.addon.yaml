        description: "How to resolve field value conflicts for an Amazon EKS add-on. Conflicts are handled based on the value you choose: \n * None – If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed on your cluster, Amazon EKS doesn't change the value. Creation of the add-on might fail. \n * Overwrite – If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed on your cluster and the Amazon EKS default value is different than the existing value, Amazon EKS changes the value to the Amazon EKS default value. \n * Preserve – Not supported. You can set this value when updating an add-on though. For more information, see UpdateAddon (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAddon.html). \n If you don't currently have the self-managed version of the add-on installed on your cluster, the Amazon EKS add-on is installed. Amazon EKS sets all values to default values, regardless of the option that you specify."

For more information, see Amazon EKS node IAM role (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html) in the Amazon EKS User Guide. \n To specify an existing IAM role, you must have an IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider created for your cluster.
