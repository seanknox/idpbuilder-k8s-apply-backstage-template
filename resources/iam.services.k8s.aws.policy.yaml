If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/). \n This parameter allows (through its regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the !

        description: "The JSON policy document that you want to use as the content for the new policy. \n You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM. \n The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see IAM and STS character quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length). \n To learn more about JSON policy grammar, see Grammar of the IAM JSON policy language (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_grammar.html) in the IAM User Guide. \n The regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following: \n * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range \n * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \\u00FF) \n * The special characters tab (\\u0009), line feed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D)"
