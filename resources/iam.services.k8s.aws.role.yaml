However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM. \n The regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following: \n * Any printable ASCII character ranging from the space character (\\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range \n * The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \\u00FF) \n * The special characters tab (\\u0009), line feed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D) \n Upon success, the response includes the same trust policy in JSON format."

        description: "The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for the specified role. If you do not specify a value for this setting, the default value of one hour is applied. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. \n Anyone who assumes the role from the or API can use the DurationSeconds API parameter or the duration-seconds CLI parameter to request a longer session. The MaxSessionDuration setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using the DurationSeconds parameter. If users don't specify a value for the DurationSeconds parameter, their security credentials are valid for one hour by default. This applies when you use the AssumeRole* API operations or the assume-role* CLI operations but does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL.

If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/). \n This parameter allows (through its regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex)) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes.
